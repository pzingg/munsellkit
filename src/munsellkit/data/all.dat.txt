all.dat.csv

These are all the Munsell data, including the extrapolated colors. Note that
extrapolated colors are in some cases unreal. That is, some lie outsize the
Macadam limits.

This file should be used for those performing multidimensional interpolation
to/from Munsell data. You will need the unreal colors in order to completely
encompass the real colors, which is required to do the interpolation when
near the Macadam limits.

real_sRGB.csv and real_CIELAB.csv

These are real colors only, "real" being those lying inside the Macadam
limits. Specifically, these are those colors listed the original 1943
renotation article (Newhall, Judd, and Nickerson, JOSA, 1943).

This file should be used for a complete mapping between the Munsell system
and its CIE equivalents. Note, however, that many of these colors were
not used in the original scaling experiments, and are therefore extrapolated
or at best interpolated from the test colors used.

See real_sRGB.txt and real_CIELAB.txt for more information on the
color space values in the two files.
